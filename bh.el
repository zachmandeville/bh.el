;;; Commentary:
;; These are functions lifted out from 'org-mode: organize your life in plaintext!' (http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html)
;; I found them extremely helpful and wanted an easy way to share them with friends who didn't want to spend a bunch of
;; time defining functions, so I organized them into a package.  It's not intended for use outside of friends,
;; and am v. grateful for the work done by the original author.

;;; Code:

###autoload
;; Resume clocking task when emacs is restarted
(org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
;;
;; Show lot of clocking history so it's easy to pick items off the C-F11 list
(setq org-clock-history-length 23)
;; Resume clocking task on clock-in if the clock is open
(setq org-clock-in-resume t)
;; Change tasks to NEXT when clocking in
(setq org-clock-in-switch-to-state 'bh/clock-in-to-next)
;; Separate drawers for clocking and logs
(setq org-drawers (quote ("PROPERTIES" "LOGBOOK")))
;; Save clock data and state changes and notes in the LOGBOOK drawer
(setq org-clock-into-drawer t)
;; Sometimes I change tasks I'm clocking quickly - this removes clocked tasks with 0:00 duration
(setq org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks t)
;; Clock out when moving task to a done state
(setq org-clock-out-when-done t)
;; Save the running clock and all clock history when exiting Emacs, load it on startup
(setq org-clock-persist t)
;; Do not prompt to resume an active clock
(setq org-clock-persist-query-resume nil)
;; Enable auto clock resolution for finding open clocks
(setq org-clock-auto-clock-resolution (quote when-no-clock-is-running))
